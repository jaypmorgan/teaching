* Introduction

** Course introduction

*** What...? Why...?

- Programming is much more than the act of programming a small script. Even if you've
  programmed before, doing so for a research project requires a lot of rigour to
  ensure the results you're reporting are correct, and reproducible.
- There is so much surrounding the act of programming that it can get a little
  overwhelming. Things from setting up a programming environment to managing multiple
  experiments on the supercomputers can involve many languages and understanding of
  technologies.
- This course is designed to take you from not being able to program at all to being
  able to do it comfortably for your research and work.

*** What is this course going to teach me?

1. Programming with the Python Programming Language.
   + Basic syntax.
   + Introduction to the basics of object oriented programming (OOP).
   + Numerical computing with numpy/pandas/scipy.
2. Doing your programming in a Linux-based Environment (GNU/Linux) and being
   comfortable with the organisation of this Linux environment.
   + Setting up a research (reproducible) environment.
   + Executing experiments.
3. Interacting with the Super-computers/clusters.
   + Interaction with SLURM (management of jobs).
4. Taking the results from a program you've created, be able to visualise them and
   include them in reports/papers.
   + LaTeX/Markdown.
   + Plotting.

*** How the course will be delivered

- 2/3 hour sessions over the next 2 months.
- Throughout the lecture, there will be small exercises to try out what we've
  learnt. We will go through the answers to these exercises.
- At the end of the lecture we will have a larger exercise that will become more
  challenging. These exercises are not marked, but again, just an opportunity to try
  out what you've learnt. The best way to learn how to program is to program.

- Python is a /high-level/\footnoteframe{As we go through our lectures we'll understand what it means for the language to be /high-level/ and /interpreted/ and why that is helpful for us.} programming language created in 1991.
- While it is an old language, its become vastly popular thanks to its use in data
  science and other mathematics-based disciplines. While also being able to perform
  tasks such as GUI, web-development and much more.
- Because the language is high-level and /interpreted/, programmers can often find
  themselves more productive in Python than in other languages such as say C++.

*** A first program

We're going to start with the 'Hello, World' program that prints =Hello, World!= to the
screen. In python this is as simple as writing:

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :post commentify(*this*)
print("Hello, World!")   # this prints: Hello, World!
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => Hello, World!

*NOTE* anything following a =#= is a comment and is completely ignored by the
computer. It is there for you to document your code for others, and most
importantly, for yourself.

*** Running this program

Before we can run this program, we need to save it somewhere. For this, will
create a new file, insert this text, and save it as =<filename>.py=, where
=<filename>= is what we want to call the script. This name doesn't matter for its
execution.

Once we have created the /script/, we can run it from the /command line/. We will
get into the command line in a later lecture, but right now all you need to know
is:

#+begin_src bash
python3 <filename>.py
#+end_src

*** An alternative method of running python

You may notice that if you don't give =python= a filename to run, you will enter
something called the =REPL=.

#+begin_src bash
Python 3.9.5 (default, Jun  4 2021, 12:28:51) 
[GCC 7.5.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
#+end_src

=REPL= stands for =READ=, =EXECUTE=, =PRINT=, =LOOP=.

*** Variables

A /variable/ is a /symbol/ associated with a /value/. This value can differ widely, and we
will take a look at different types of values/data later.

Neverthless, variables are useful for /referring/ to values and /storing/ to the results
of a computation.

#+begin_src python :post commentify(*this*)
x = 1
y = 2
z = x + y
print(z)   # prints: 3

# variables can be /overwritten/
z = "hello, world"
print(z)   # prints: hello, world
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 3
: # => hello, world

#+begin_comment
- Write descriptive variable names
- Convention in writing variable names: myvariable, my_variable, myVariable
- Variables in python are case-sensitive, my_Variable, is different to my_variable
#+end_comment

** Types of data

*** Primitive data types

Primitive data types are the most fundamental parts of programming, they cannot
be /broken/ down.

#+begin_src python
"Hello" # string
1       # integer
1.0     # float
True    # Boolean (or bool for short)
#+end_src

*** Primitive data type

We can get the type of some data by using the =type(...)= function. For example,

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :post commentify(*this*)
print(type(5))
print(type(5.0))

x = "all cats meow"

print(type(x))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => <class 'int'>
: # => <class 'float'>
: # => <class 'str'>
 
*** Basic Math with primitives

Using these primitive data types, we can do some basic math operations!

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :post commentify(*this*)
print(1 + 2)    # Addtion
print(1 - 2)    # Subtraction
print(1 * 2)    # Multiplication
print(1 / 2)    # Division
print(2 ** 2)   # Exponent
print(3 % 2)    # Modulo operator
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 3
: # => -1
: # => 2
: # => 0.5
: # => 4
: # => 1

*** Basic Math

Sometimes types get converted to the same type:

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :post commentify(*this*)
print(1.0 + 2)  # float + integer = float
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 3.0

Even more interesting is with Booleans!

#+begin_src python :results pp value :session :post commentify(*this*)
True + True
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 2

*** BODMAS in Python

Like in mathematics, certain math operator take precedence over others.

- B - Brackets
- O - Orders (roots, exponents)
- D - division
- M - multiplication
- A - addition
- S - subtraction.

To make the context clear as to what operations to perform first, use brackets.

#+begin_src python :results pp value :session :post commentify(*this*)
(5 / 5) + 1
5 / (5 + 1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 2.0
: # => 0.8333333333333334

*** Basic Math -- Quick exercise

Write the following equation in python:

$(5 + 2) \times (\frac{10}{2} + 10)^2$

*Remember* to use parentheses =( )= to ensure that operations take precedence over
others.

Your answer should come out as: =1575.0=

*** Container data types/Data structures

Container data types or data structures, as the name suggests, are used to contain
other things. Types of containers are:

- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

#+begin_src python
[1, "hello", 2]                 # list
{"my-key": 2, "your-key": 1}    # dictionary (or dict)
(1, 2)                          # tuple
set(1, 2)                       # set
#+end_src

We'll take a look at each of these different container types and explore why we
might want to use each of them.

*** An aside on Terminology

To make our explanations clearer and reduce confusion, each of the different symbols
have unique names.

I will use this terminology consistently throughout the course, and it is common to
see the same use outside the course.

- =[ ]= brackets (square brackets).
- ={ }= braces (curly braces).
- =( )= parentheses.

*** Lists

A hetreogenious container. This means that it can store any type of data.

#+begin_src python :results none :session *x*
x = [1, "hello", 2]
#+end_src

Elements can be accessed using indexing =[ ]= notation. For example:

#+begin_src python :session *x* :results output pp :post commentify(*this*)
print(x[0])    # this will get the first element (i.e. 1)
print(x[1])    # the second element (i.e. "hello")
print(x[2])    # the third element (i.e. 2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 1
: # => hello
: # => 2

*notice how the first element is the 0-th item in the list/* we say that python is
0-indexed.

*** Lists -- adding data

If we want to add items to the end of the list, we use the =append= function:

#+begin_src python :results pp output :post commentify(*this*)
my_list = []

my_list.append("all")
my_list.append("dogs")
my_list.append("bark")

print(my_list)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => ['all', 'dogs', 'bark']

*** Lists -- Quick Exercise

- Create a list with 3 elements:

- "bark"
- "all"
- "dogs"

- Assign this to a variable with the name of your choice.
- Using the =print= function, print out the 3rd, 1st and 2nd elements in that order.

*** Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a little different from lists as each 'element' consists of a
key-pair value. Let's have a look at some examples where the dictionaries contains
*one* element:

#+begin_src python :session *x2* :results none
my_dictionary = {"key": "value"}
my_other_dict = {"age": 25}
#+end_src

To access the /value/, we get it using =[key]= notation:

#+begin_src python :results pp value :session *x2* :post commentify(*this*)
my_other_dict["age"]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 25

*NOTE* keys are unique, i.e:

#+begin_src python :results pp value :post commentify(*this*)
my_dictionary = {"age": 25, "age": 15}
my_dictionary["age"]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 15

*** Dictionaries

The key in the dictionary doesn't necessarily need to be a string. For example, in
this case, we have created two key-pair elements, where the keys to both are tuples
of numbers.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :post commentify(*this*)
my_dictionary = {(1, 2): "square", (3, 4): "circle"}

print(my_dictionary[(1, 2)])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => square

*** Dictionaries -- adding data

If we want to add data to a dictionary, we simply perform the accessor method with a
key that is not in the dictionary:

#+begin_src python :results pp output :post commentify(*this*)
my_dict = {}

my_dict["name"] = "James"
my_dict["age"] = 35

print(my_dict)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => {'name': 'James', 'age': 35}

*** Dictionaries -- Quick Exercise

- Create a dictionary for the following address, and assign it a variable name
  called =address=:

| Key    | Value         |
|--------+---------------|
| number | 22            |
| street | Bakers Street |
| city   | London        |

- Print out the address's street name using the =[ ]= accessor with the correct key.

*** Tuples

#+begin_src python :session *x3* :results none
my_tuple = (1, 56, -2)
#+end_src

Like lists, elements of the tuple can be accessed by their position in the list,
starting with the 0-th element:

#+begin_src python :session *x3* :results output :post commentify(*this*) 
print(my_tuple[0])  # => 1
print(my_tuple[1])  # => 56
print(my_tuple[2])  # => -2
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 1
: # => 56
: # => -2

*** Tuples

Unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed after they've been created. We say they are
*immutable*. So this will *not* work:

#+begin_src python :session *x3* :results value :post commentify(*this*)
my_tuple[2] = "dogs"  # creates an Error
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => Traceback (most recent call last):
:   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
:   File "/tmp/pyKdIIcx", line 18, in <module>
:   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
: TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

*** Sets

Sets in Python are like tuples, but contain only unique elements.

You can use the =set( )= function (*more on functions later!*), supplying a list, to create a set:

#+begin_src python :results value pp :post commentify(*this*)
my_set = set([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4])
my_set
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => {1, 2, 3, 4}

Notice how there is only one '2' in the resulting set, duplicate elements are removed.

*** Sets -- adding data

If we want to add data to a set, we use the =.add()= method. The element used as an
argument to this function will only be added to the set if it is not already in the
set.

#+begin_src python :results output pp :post commentify(*this*)
my_set = set([])

my_set.add(1)
my_set.add(2)
my_set.add(1)

print(my_set)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => {1, 2}

** Conditional expressions

*** If statement

If statements allow for branching paths of execution. In other words, we can execute
some statements if some conditions holds (or does not hold).

The structure of a simple if statement is:

#+begin_src python
if <condition>:
    <body>
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 2
y = "stop"

if x < 5:
    print("X is less than five")
if y == "go":
    print("All systems go!!")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => X is less than five

*** If statement

In the previous example, the first =print= statement was only executed if the =x < 5=
evaluates to =True=, but in python, we can add another /branch/ if the condition
evaluates to =False=. This branch is denoted by the =else= keyword.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

if x < 5:
    print("X is less than five")
else:
    print("X is greater than or equal to five")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => X is greater than or equal to five

*** If statement -- Quick Exercise 1

- Create a variable called =age= and assign the value of this variable =35=.
- Create and =if= statement that prints the square of =age= if the value of =age= is more
  than 24.
- This if statement should have an else condition, that prints =age= divided by 2.
- What is the printed value?

*** If statement

If we wanted to add multiple potential paths, we can add more using the =elif
<condition>= keywords.

Note: The conditions are checked from top to bottom, only executing the else if none
evaluate to =True=. The first condition that evaluates to =True= is executed, the rest
are skipped.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 15

if x < 5:
    print("X is less than five")
elif x > 10:
    print("X is greater than ten")
else:
    print("X is between five and ten")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => X is greater than ten

*** If statement

Sometimes, we might want to conditionally set a variable a value. For this, we can
use an /inline/ if statement. The form of an inline if statement is:

=<value-if-true> if <condition> else <value-if-false>=

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

y = 5 if x > 5 else 2

print(x + y)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 15

*** Boolean Logic

As we've seen, =if= statements are checking for conditions to evaluate to =True= or
=False=. In python we use various comparison operators to check for conditions that
evaluate to =Booleans=.

Comparison operators

- =<= less than
- =<== less than or equal to
- =>= greater than
- =>== greater than or equal to
- ==== is equal to
- =not= negation

If we want to check for multiple conditions, we can use conjunctives or disjunctive
operators to combine the Boolean formulas.

Conjunctives/Disjunctives

- =and= all boolean expressions must evaluate to true
- =or= only one expression needs to be true

*** Boolean Logic

Using =not= you can invert the Boolean result of the expression.

#+begin_src python  :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
print(not True)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => False

#+begin_src python  :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

if not x == 11:
    print("X is not 11")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => X is not 11
  
*** Boolean Logic

Let's take an example using the =and= keyword. =and= here is checking that =x= is above or
equal to 10 *and* =y= is exactly 5. If either of the conditions is =False=, python will
execute the =else= path (if there is one, of course!).

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10
y = 5

if x >= 10 and y == 5:
    z = x + y
else:
    z = x * y

print(z)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 15

*** Boolean Logic

Here we see the use of the =or= keyword. If any of the conditions evaluates to =True=
then the whole condition evaluates to =True=.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10
y = 5

if x < 5 or y == 5:
    print("We got here!")
else:
    print("We got here instead...")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => We got here!

*** Boolean Logic

Note: =or= is short-circuiting. This means that if tests the conditions left-to-right,
and when it finds something that is =True= it stops evaluating the rest of the
conditions.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

if x < 20 or print("We got to this condition"):
    print("The value of x is", x) 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => The value of x is 10

*** Boolean Logic

If your Boolean logic refers to a single variable, you can combine the logic without
the =and= and =or=. But its not always common.

For example,

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 7

if x < 10 and x > 4:
    print("X is between 5 and 10")
#+end_src

Can be the same as:

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 7

if 5 < x < 10:
    print("X is between 5 and 10")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => X is between 5 and 10

** Iteration

*** For loop

Looping or iteration allows us to perform a series of actions multiple times. We are
going to start with the more useful =for= loop in python. The syntax of a =for= loop is:

#+begin_src python
for <variable_name> in <iterable>:
    <body>
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 0
: # => 1
: # => 2

*** For loop -- break

The previous example loops over the body a fix number of times. But what if we wanted
to stop looping early? Well, we can use the =break= keyword. This keyword will exit the
body of the loop.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
for i in range(10):
    if i > 5:
        break
    print(i)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 0
: # => 1
: # => 2
: # => 3
: # => 4
: # => 5

*** For loop -- continue

A different keyword you might want to use is =continue=. Continue allows you to move/skip
onto the next iteration without executing the entire body of the =for= loop.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 1
: # => 3
: # => 5
: # => 7
: # => 9

*** For loop -- ranges

Instead of using =continue= like in the previous slide, the =range= function provides us
with some options:

=range(start, stop, step)=

In this example, we are starting our iteration at 10, ending at 15, but stepping the
counter 2 steps.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
for i in range(10, 15, 2):
    print(i)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 10
: # => 12
: # => 14

*** For loop -- loop over collections

For loops allow us to iterate over a collection, taking one element at a time. Take
for example, a list, and for every item in the list we print its square.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
my_list = [1, 5, 2, 3, 5.5]

for el in my_list:
    print(el**2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 1
: # => 25
: # => 4
: # => 9
: # => 30.25

*** For loop -- loop over collections

This kind of looping can work for tuples and sets, but as we have seen, dictionaries
are a little different. Every 'element' in a dictionary consists of a key and a
value. Therefore when we iterate over items in a dictionary, we can assign the key
and value to different variables in the loop.

*Note* the use of the =.items()= after the dictionary. We will explore this later.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
my_dict = {"name": "jane", "age": 35, "loc": "France"}

for el_key, el_val in my_dict.items():
    print("Key is:", el_key, " value is: ", el_val)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => Key is: name  and the value is:  jane
: # => Key is: age  and the value is:  35
: # => Key is: location  and the value is:  France


*** For loop -- loop over collections

We could also loop over the keys in the dictionary using the =.keys()= method instead
of =.items()=.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
my_dict = {"name": "jane", "age": 35, "loc": "France"}

for the_key in my_dict.keys():
    print(the_key)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => name
: # => age
: # => loc

*** For loop -- loop over collections

Or, the values using =.values()=.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
my_dict = {"name": "jane", "age": 35, "loc": "France"}

for the_value in my_dict.values():
    print(the_value)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => jane
: # => 35
: # => France

*** For loop -- Quick Exercise

- Create a list of elements:

  + 2
  + "NA"
  + 24
  + 5

- Use a =for= loop to iterate over this list.
- In the body of the =for= loop, compute $2x + 1$, where $x$ is the current element of
  the list.
- Store the result of this computation in a new variable $y$, and then print y.

*Note* You cannot compute $2x + 1$ of "NA", therefore you will to use an =if= statement
to skip onto the next iteration if it encounters this. *Hint* try: =type(...) =!== =str=

*** While loop

A =while= loop is another looping concept like =for= but it can loop for an arbitrary
amount of times. A =while= loop looks to see if the condition is =True=, and if it is, it
will execute the body.

The syntax of the while loop is:

#+begin_src python
while <condition>:
    <body>
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
i = 0

while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 0
: # => 1
: # => 2

*** COMMENT While loop

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 0
y = 1

while x + y < 10:
    print("X is,", x, "and y is", y)
    x = x + 1
    y = y * 2

print("X ended as", x, ", while y is", y)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => X is, 0 and y is 1
: # => X is, 1 and y is 2
: # => X is, 2 and y is 4
: # => X ended as 3 , while y is 8

** Functions
*** Functions

Functions are a re-usable set of instructions that can take some arguments and
possible return something.

The basic structure of a function is as follows:

#+begin_src python
def <function_name>(args*):
    <body>
    (optional) return
#+end_src

- =args*= are 0 to many comma separated symbols.
- =body= is to be indented by 4 spaces.

This is only the function /definition/ however. To make it do something, we must /'call'/
the function, and supply the arguments as specified in the definition.

#+begin_src python
def say_hello():   # function definition
    print("Hello, World!")

say_hello()  # calling the function
#+end_src

*** Functions

We've already seen some functions provided by Python.

=print= itself is a function with a single argument: what we want to print.

#+begin_src python
print("Hello, World!")
# ^         ^
# |         |
# | user supplied argument
# |
# function name 
#+end_src

=set= is another function that takes a single argument: a collection of data with which
to make a set:

#+begin_src python
set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])
#+end_src

*** Example usage of a function

Let's make a function that takes two numbers and adds them together:

#+begin_src python :results output pp :post commentify(*this*)
def my_addition(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

x = 2
y = 3
z = my_addition(2, 3)  # return 5 and stores in z
print(z)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 5

*** Functions -- Quick Exercise

- Create a function called =my_square=. This function should take one argument (you can
  call this argument what you like).
- The body of the function should compute and return the square of the argument.
- Call this function with =5.556=.
- Store the result of calling this function, and print it.
- What is the result?

*** Re-usability with Functions

Functions are better illustrated through some examples, so let's see some!

#+begin_src python
name_1 = "john"
name_2 = "mary"
name_3 = "michael"

print("Hello " + name_1 + ", how are you?")
print("Hello " + name_2 + ", how are you?")
print("Hello " + name_3 + ", how are you?")
#+end_src

The above is pretty wasteful. Why? Because we are performing the exact same
operation multiple times, with only the variable changed.

*** Re-usability with Functions

By abstracting the actions we want to perform into a function, we can ultimately
reduce the amount of code we write. /Be a lazy programmer!/

#+begin_src python
name_1 = "john"
name_2 = "mary"
name_3 = "michael"

def say_hello(name):
    print("Hello " + name + ", how are you?")

say_hello(name_1)
say_hello(name_2)
say_hello(name_3)
#+end_src

In this example, we've used the function as defined with the =def= pattern to write
the =print= statement once. Then, we've called the function with each variable as its
argument.

*** Named parameters

We've seen in previous examples that, when we create a function, we give each of the
arguments (if there are any) a name.

When calling this function, we can specify these same names such as:

#+begin_src python :results output pp :post commentify(*this*)
def say_hello(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

say_hello("Micheal")
say_hello(name="Micheal")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => Hello, Micheal
: # => Hello, Micheal

*** Named parameters

By specifying the name of the parameter we're using with the called function, we can
change the order

#+begin_src python :results output pp :post commentify(*this*)
def say_greeting(greeting, name):
    print(greeting, name, "I hope you're having a good day")

say_greeting(name="John", greeting="Hi")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => Hi John I hope you're having a good day

*** Optional/Default/Positional arguments

When we call a function with arguments without naming them, we are supplying them by
/position/.

#+begin_src python
def say_greeting(greeting, name):
    print(greeting, name, "I hope you're having a good day")

say_greeting(#first position, #section position)
#+end_src

The first position gets mapped to variable name of =greeting= inside the body of the
=say_greeting= function, while the second position gets mapped to =name=. 

*** Optional/Default/Positional arguments

Sometimes when creating a function we may want to use default arguments, these are
arguments that are used if the call to the function does not specify what their value
should be. For example.

#+begin_src python :results output pp :post commentify(*this*)
def say_greeting(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(greeting, name, "I hope you're having a good day")

say_greeting("John")
say_greeting("John", "Hi")  # supply greeting as positional argument
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => Hello John I hope you're having a good day
: # => Hi John I hope you're having a good day

*** Optional/Default/Positional arguments

*Note* if you supply a default argument in the function definition, all arguments after
this default argument must also supply a default argument.

So, this *won't* work:

#+begin_src python :results output pp :post commentify(*this*)
def say_greeting(name="Jane", greeting):
    print(greeting, name, "I hope you're having a good day")

say_greeting("John", "Hi")
#+end_src


*** Recap on arguments

#+begin_src python
# defining the function

def say_greeting(name, greeting)  # no default arguments
def say_greeting(name, greeting="Hello")  # greeting is a default argument
def say_greeting(name="Jane", greeting="Hello")  # both arguments have a default

# calling the functions

say_greeting("John", "Hi")  # both arguments are provided by position
say_greeting(name="John", greeting="Hi")  # arguments are supplied by name
say_greeting(greeting="Hi", name="John")  # the position of named arguments do not matter
#+end_src


*** Function doc-strings

To make it clear for a human to quickly understand what a function is doing, you can
add an optional doc-string. This is a string that is added directly after the initial
definition of the function:

#+begin_src python
def my_function(x, y):
    """I am a docstring!!!"""
    return x + y
#+end_src

Some common use cases for docstrings are explaining what the parameters are that it
expects, and what it returns.

*** Multi-line docstrings

If your explanation is a little longer than a line, a multiline docstring can be
created as long as you're using ="""= three quotation marks either side of the string

#+begin_src python
def my_function(x, y):
    """
    This is my realllly long docstring
    that explains how the function works. But sometimes
    its best not to explain the obvious
    """
    return x + y
#+end_src

*** Understanding scope

In this example we have two scopes which can be easily seen by the indentation. The
first is the /global/ scope. The second scope is the scope of the function. The scope
of the function can reference variables in the larger scope. But once the function
scope exits, we can no longer reference the variables from the function.

#+begin_src python  :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

def compute_addition(y):
    return x + y

print(compute_addition(10))
print(x)
print(y)  # does not work
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 20
: # => 10

*** Understanding scope

Even though we can reference the global scope variable from the scope of the
function, we can't modify it like this:

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

def compute_addition_2(y):
    x = x + 5  # error local variable referenced before assignment
    return x + y

print(compute_addition_2(10))
#+end_src

*** Understanding scope

If we really wanted to reference a variable in a global scope and modify its value,
we could use the =global= keyword. Doing this makes the
function output something different every time it is called. This can make it
difficult to debug incorrect programs.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

def compute_addition_2(y):
    global x
    x = x + 5
    return x + y

print(compute_addition_2(10))
print(x)
print(compute_addition_2(10))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 25
: # => 15
: # => 30

*** Understanding scope

In almost all cases, avoid using global variables. Instead pass the variables as
parameters. This can reduce a source of potential errors and ensure that if a
function is called multiple times, the output can be more consistent and expected.

#+begin_src python :results pp output :session :exports both :post commentify(*this*)
x = 10

def compute_addition_3(x, y):
    x = x + 5
    return x + y

print(compute_addition_3(x, 10))
print(x)
print(compute_addition_3(x, 10))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Results: 
: # => 25
: # => 10
: # => 25

* Exercise

** Library system

*** Use what you've learnt!

We're going to create a library system to help locate and lookup information about
books. For example, we want to know the author of book called 'Moby Dick'.

To create this system, we are going to do it in stages. First, we will want to create
our database of books:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tabularx :width \textwidth :align XXX
| Title                           | Author                 | Release Date |
|---------------------------------+------------------------+--------------|
| Moby Dick                       | Herman Melville        |         1851 |
| A Study in Scarlet              | Sir Arthur Conan Doyle |         1887 |
| Frankenstein                    | Mary Shelley           |         1818 |
| Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy | Douglas Adams          |         1879 |

Our database is going to be a list of dictionaries. Where each dictionary is a row
from this table. For example, one of the dictionaries will have the key "title" and a
value "Moby Dick".

Create this database and call it =db=.

*** Locating Books

- Create a function called =locate_by_title= that takes the database to look through,
  and the title to look up as arguments.
- This function should check each dictionary, and if the title is the same as what
  was searched for, it should return the whole dictionary.
- Test this function by calling the =locate_by_title= function with =db= and
  ="Frankenstein"=. You should get ={"title": "Frankenstein", "author": ...}=.

*Note* you should include docstrings to describe the arguments to the function, and
what it will return.

*** Selecting a subset

Now that we can find books by the title name, we also want to find all books that
were released after a certain data.

- Create a function called =books_released_after= that takes two arguments: the
  database to look through, and the year.
- This function should look through the database, if it finds a book that was
  released after the year, it should add it to a list of books that is returned from
  this function.
- Test this function by calling =books_released_after= with =db= and =1850=. This function
  call should return a list containing three dictionaries. The first entry should be
  'Moby Dick' and the section should be 'A Study in Scarlet', etc.

*** Updating our database

Oh no! 'Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' was released in 1979 not 1879, there must
have been a typo. Let's create a function to update this.

- Create a function called =update=, that takes 5 arguments: 1) the database to
  update, 2) the key of the value we want to update 3) the value we want to update it
  to 4) the key we want to check to find out if we have the correct book and 5) the
  value of the key to check if we have the correct book.

  #+begin_src python
  update(db,
	 key="release year",
	 value=1979,
	 where_key="title",
	 where_value="Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy")
  #+end_src

*** Extended exercise

- In the previous steps we created functions =locate_by_title= and
  =books_released_after=. These two functions are similar in a way that they are
  selecting a subset of our database (just by different criteria).
- For this harder exercise, can we create a single function called =query= that allows
  us to do both =locate_by_title= and =books_released_after=.
- An example call to this =query= function may look like:

  #+begin_src python
  results = query(db,
		  where_key="title",
		  where_value="Moby Dick",
		  where_qualifier="exactly")
  #+end_src

- =where_qualifier= should accept strings like ="exactly"=, ="greater than"=, and ="less
  than"=.

* What lies ahead

** What lies ahead

*** What lies ahead

- Now that we've seen /some/ of the basic syntax, we will continue on and learn how to
  work more with data. This means we're going to revisit lists/sets/dictionaries, and
  look at methods like =.items()=, =.values()=, etc, and find out why they look slightly
  different to the functions we've created in this lecture!
- We're going to look at object-oriented programming (OOP) in python and learn how to
  use the style of programming to best effect.
