In this series of lectures, we'll be delving into the broad world of programming for research!\n\n\n-   Programming is much more than the act of programming a small script. Even if you've\n    programmed before, doing so for a research project requires a lot of rigour to\n    ensure the results you're reporting are correct, and reproducible.\n-   There is so much surrounding the act of programming that it can get a little\n    overwhelming. Things from setting up a programming environment to managing multiple\n    experiments on the supercomputers can involve many languages and understanding of\n    technologies.\n-   This course is designed to take you from not being able to program at all to being\n    able to do it comfortably for your research and work.\n\n\n## What is this course going to teach me?\n\n1.  Programming with the Python Programming Language.\n    -   Basic syntax.\n    -   Introduction to the basics of object oriented programming (OOP).\n    -   Numerical computing with numpy/pandas/scipy.\n2.  Doing your programming in a Linux-based Environment (GNU/Linux) and being\n    comfortable with the organisation of this Linux environment.\n    -   Setting up a research (reproducible) environment.\n    -   Executing experiments.\n3.  Interacting with the Super-computers/clusters.\n    -   Interaction with SLURM (management of jobs).\n4.  Taking the results from a program you've created, be able to visualise them and\n    include them in reports/papers.\n    -   LaTeX/Markdown.\n    -   Plotting.\n\n## How the course will be delivered\n\n-   2/3 hour sessions over the next 2 months.\n-   Throughout the lecture, there will be small exercises to try out what we've\n    learnt. We will go through the answers to these exercises.\n-   At the end of the lecture we will have a larger exercise that will become more\n    challenging.
