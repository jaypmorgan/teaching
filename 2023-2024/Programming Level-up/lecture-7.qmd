# Pandas


<a id="org88f51ec"></a>

## Introduction


<a id="org808a9ea"></a>

### What is Pandas?

![img](./images/pandas.jpg)

-   Pandas a library to make the representation and manipulation of tabular data
    easier in Python.
-   A table of data is called a 'Dataframe' that consists of named columns and
    (optionally) named rows.
-   <https://pandas.pydata.org/>


<a id="org0154b08"></a>

### Installing and importing pandas

To install pandas, we can either use conda:

    conda install pandas

or with pip:

    pip install pandas

After pandas has been installed. We shall import it into our scripts (using the
common convention of aliasing the library as pd):

    import pandas as pd


<a id="org331607a"></a>

### Creating a dataframe

Now that pandas has been successfully imported, we're ready to create and
manipulate our own dataframes. To create a dataframe, we first need to organise
our data in appropriate format. Perhaps one of the most simple formats for this
data is a dictionary, where each value is a list:

    data = {"col1": [1, 2], "col2": [3, 4]}

We see that each 'key' is the representation of a column of data, and the value
of this key is a list of data for this column. To convert this data to a
dataframe, we need only to call the DataFrame class:

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)


<a id="org5a0d6f4"></a>

### Creating a dataframe

`df` (dataframe for short) is now our representation of the dataframe:

![img](images/simple_dataframe.png)

We see that each column is named using the keys in our `data` dictionary, and the
values of the column correspond to the elements in the list. To the left of the
dataframe we have a numerical index starting at 0.


<a id="org5ac5376"></a>

### Access elements in our dataframe

Extracting particular values from this dataframe can be accomplished using the
`loc` and `iloc` class methods. First let's look at using `loc`, and later on we'll
investigate the differences between these two methods.

Let's say we want to get all the data for the first row of our dataframe:

    df.loc[0]

![img](images/series.png)

This returns a 'Series', which is just a representation of a vector of data.


<a id="org8a15b26"></a>

### Access elements in our dataframe

To access a single value from this series, we can specify the column name:

    df.loc[0]["col1"]  # returns one

Or, we can more simply add the column name into the `loc`:

    df.loc[0, "col1"]

If we wanted to retrieve a subset of columns, we supply a list of column names:

    df.loc[0, ["col1", "col2"]]


<a id="orgffdf967"></a>

### Access elements in our dataframe

We can also use the slice notation to access multiple rows:

    df.loc[0:2, "col1"]

This retrieves the values in `col1`.

Or if we just wanted to get the entire column of data, we could instead do:

    df["col1"]


<a id="org49c51a7"></a>

## Manipulating data


<a id="org6cd5932"></a>

### Reading a CSV file

Instead of manually constructing our data and then passing it to a DataFrame, we
can use pandas to read directly from a CSV file and return a DataFrame:

Let's say we have a CSV file of measurements of Iris flowers called `iris.csv`. We
can read this CSV file using the `pd.read_csv` method.

    df = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")

![img](images/pandas.jpg)


<a id="org66c28c1"></a>

### Selecting a subset of data

With this more complex dataset, we can use more fancy methods of indexing. For
example, let's select all the rows where the sepal length is less than 5 cm.

    df[df["sepal length (cm)"] < 5]

![img](images/subset.png)

Instead of the 150 rows we had before, this returns just 22. We can also specify
only the columns we want with this conditional expression:

    df[df["sepal length (cm)"] < 5]["sepal width (cm)"]


<a id="orgb857f44"></a>

### Creating new columns

We can add new columns to this dataset by using the assignment operator. In this
example, we're creating a new column called 'sepal sum' to be the sum of both
the 'sepal width' and 'sepal length':

    df["sepal sum"] = df["sepal width (cm)"] + df["sepal length (cm)"]

![img](images/new-column.png)


<a id="orgfc90624"></a>

## Inspecting our data


<a id="org09e27b7"></a>

### Shape of the data

We can also further see that our new column has been added by inspecting the
`shape` of the data.

    df.shape

    (150, 5)

This returns a tuple corresponding to the number of rows (150) and the number of
columns (5).


<a id="org9aee141"></a>

### Getting the names of columns

To find out what the names of the columns are we can use the `columns` attribute:

    df.columns

    Index(['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)',
           'petal width (cm)', 'sepal sum'],
          dtype='object')

This returns an Index that can itself be indexed in the usual way:

    df.columns[0]

    'sepal length (cm)'


<a id="org129021e"></a>

### Head/tail

We can get the first/last few rows of the data using the `.head()` or `.tail()`
methods. These take an optional argument specifying the number of rows to
view. By default, it will show 10 rows.

    df.head()  # shows the first 10 rows
    df.head(5) # shows the first 5 rows
    
    df.tail()  # shows the last 10 rows
    df.tail(5) # shows the last 5 rows


<a id="org4b38ac2"></a>

## Operations


<a id="org0128c04"></a>

### Operations on data

Pandas comes with a few standard methods to perform some basic operations. For
example, you can calculate the mean of a column:

    df["sepal length (cm)"].mean()

And you can use the `apply()` method to apply a function to every element
(i.e. map a function to every element):

    df["sepal length (cm)"].apply(lambda x: x * 2)

Apply takes a function as an argument, and here we're using an anonymous
(unnamed function) using a lambda expression
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions>

This lambda expression will double its input, and therefore applying this
function to every element will double all values in 'sepal length (cm)'.


<a id="orged1ab30"></a>

### Apply operation to entire row

In the previous example, we saw the use of `.apply`, where a function is
applied to each individual element in a column. With `apply`, it's also
possible to apply a function to each row of a dataframe, by specifying
`axis=1` in the call to `apply`:

    # some df with value column defined here
    
    def window_sum(row, window=5):
        """Take a sum of rows within a window"""
        curr_index = row.name  # access the row index number using .name
        row["moving_avg"] = df.loc[curr_index-window:curr_index, "value"].sum()
        return row  # return the updated row
    
    updated_df = df.apply(moving_avg, axis=1)


<a id="org485d6f1"></a>

### Merge

Many pandas dataframes can be combined together using the `concat` method that
requires a list of dataframes as input.

    data1 = pd.DataFrame({"col1": [0, 1], "col2": [0, 1]})
    data2 = pd.DataFrame({"col1": [2, 3], "col2": [2, 3]})
    
    combined = pd.concat([data1, data2])

![img](images/combined.png)


<a id="org50e6da6"></a>

### More on indexing

![img](images/combined.png)

Notice how the indexes are repeated. We can also verify this using the `.index`
attribute:

    combined.index

    Int64Index([0, 1, 0, 1], dtype='int64')

We can see two '0's and two '1's. Normally, this is not a problem, but it does
have an effect on when we index our data with `loc`.


<a id="org0739ace"></a>

### More on indexing

    combined.loc[1]

![img](images/indexing.png)

Notice how `loc` has returned two rows because it sees two rows with the index
label of 1. If instead we simply meant: give me the second row we should use
`iloc`:

    combined.iloc[1]

Which will give us the desired outcome.


<a id="org4b8fced"></a>

### Resetting indexes

Alternatively we can reset the index labels:

    combined.reset_index()

![img](images/reset-index.png)

This will compute a new series of indexes for our data, and then using `loc` again
will only return the one row.


<a id="orgc0f4f4d"></a>

### Resetting indexes

To save the result of `reset_index()` we need to overwrite our original data:

    combined = combined.reset_index()

Or specify `inplace`:

    combined.reset_index(inplace=True)


<a id="orgad5ebb6"></a>

## Different types of data


<a id="org7ac929f"></a>

### Categorical data

So far, we've only seen numerical data. One of the advantages of using pandas
for tabular data is that we can represent various other types of data that makes
our manipulation and operations on different data types simpler. For example, we
can represent 'categorical data' where there is a finite set of values or
categories.

    df = pd.DataFrame({"col1": ["a", "b", "c", "a"],
                       "col2": [1, 2, 5, 4]})

Right now, `df` is simply representing 'col1' as strings, but we can change the
representation to categorical elements with:

    df["col1"] = df["col1"].astype("category")


<a id="orgccb0316"></a>

### Categorical data

With categorical data, we can perform operations on these groups a lot quicker
than if we were just to represent them on strings. For instance, lets compute
the sum of 'col2' for each group.

    df.groupby("col1").sum()

![img](images/categorical.png)

If we have lots of data, having 'col1' `astype('category')` will be a lot more
computationally efficient than leaving them as strings.


<a id="org26745a9"></a>

### Dates and times

If you have a column that represents a date or time, you can convert that column
to a true datetime representation with `pd.to_datetime`

    df = pd.DataFrame({"col1": ["2002/01/30", "2010/05/16"]})
    df["col1"] = pd.to_datetime(df["col1"])

In addition to make indexing by dates a lot faster, it also provides us with
some convienant methods to extract particular components from the data. Such as
the year:

    df["col1"].dt.year # or df["col1"].dt.month etc
